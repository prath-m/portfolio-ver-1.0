                <li>
                    as you can see this website is still in its initial phase with multiple glitches and lack of responsiveness
                </li>
                <li>
                    currently I'm a undergraduate student and have a really hectic, unordered and unpredictable schedule part of reason why working on this website takes so long time 
                </li>
                <li>
                    still I'm open for any kind of development, opensource, mentorship, research and internship opportunity.
                </li>
                <li>
